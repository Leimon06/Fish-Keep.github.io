         <p>Betta fish, also known as Siamese fighting fish, are popular in aquariums. Often called 'bettas,' they belong to the gourami family and are territorial. 
         Native to Cambodia, Vietnam, and Thailand, they inhabit standing waters like rice paddies. Despite the misconception, bettas aren't found in puddles. 
         In the wild, their territorial behavior is subdued due to ample space; 
         they may spar but won't fight to the death.</p>

            <h1>Origin and Distribution</h1>
         <p>
            Bettas, native to Southeast Asia, have spread to various locations, forming non-native populations. 
            The name "Siamese fighting fish" comes from organized male fights, still practiced for betting income. 
            In some areas, breeding focuses on aggression for better matches.

            <p>
                <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="showPopUpImage1()">Male bettas</a> are renowned for vibrant colors and
                long fins, unlike <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="showPopUpImage2()">less colorful females</a>.
                In the wild, they aren't as brightly hued. Captive breeding has produced a spectrum of colors—white, yellow, orange, red, pink, blue, green, turquoise, brown, and black. 
                Various fin types likeVeil tails have been joined by crown tails, deltas, fans, half moons, lyre, and split tails, and more have emerged through selective breeding. 
                Both sexes have torpedo-shaped bodies, upturned mouths, reaching 2-3 inches in size. 
                Unique to bettas is a labyrinth organ enabling them to extract oxygen from the air, facilitating survival in low-oxygen environments.

                Males cannot be kept together unless there are separators in the tank. 
                Multiple females can generally be kept together without problems, and a single male can also be added to the mix. 
                hey can be kept with other peaceful species of fish, as long as they are small and are not fin-nipping types, such as tiger barbs.

            <h1>Betta Habitat and Care</h1>
            <p>
                Bettas, popular in freshwater aquariums, thrive in warm water (80s°F). 
                Tank maintenance is crucial, as they become lethargic below 75°F. A heater with a built-in thermometer is essential. 
                Bettas have a unique respiratory organ, requiring access to the water surface. 
                Ideal conditions include soft, warm water, neutral to slightly acidic pH, and minimal water movement. 
                While bettas can coexist, only one male is recommended, unless separated. Plastic boxes can house multiple bettas or protect fins from tankmates.

            <h1>Diet and Feeding</h1>
            <p>
                Feed bettas 2-4 pellets twice daily. 
                In their natural habitat, they primarily consume insects. 
                Their upturned mouth is ideal for catching insects. 
                Bettas have a carnivorous digestive system, preferring live foods like brine shrimp, daphnia, plankton, tubifex, glassworms, and beef heart. 
                While they can adapt to flake foods, supplementing with frozen or freeze-dried options is recommended, and live foods are ideal if possible.

                Males typically are more brilliantly colored and have longer and flowing fins. 
                They also have a more distinct "beard" (under the gill coverings) and are larger overall than the females. 
                Females have short fins and will display vertical stripes and an egg spot when ready to mate.

            <h1>Breeding the Betta</h1>
            <p>
                Bettas breed successfully under a year old, preferring a bare-bottomed 10-gallon tank with a pH of 7.0 and a temperature around 80°F. 
                Conditioning with live foods is recommended. The male builds a bubble nest when ready to spawn. 
                After fertilization, the male cares for the nest, requiring the female's removal due to potential aggression. 
                The eggs hatch in 1-2 days, and fry feed off their yolk sack for 36 hours. 
                Remove the male within two days to prevent predation. Feed the fry baby brine shrimp or specialized dry food, avoiding overfeeding for water quality.
