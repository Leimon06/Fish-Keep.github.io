            The fantail goldfish is a common variety of fancy goldfish, known for its double tail. 
            <br>Rather than having one standard tail with a top and bottom caudal fin, 
            <br>these goldfish have been bred to have two top and bottom caudal fins, 
            <br>with the top fin being fused along the top. 
            <br>Take special consideration when keeping fantail goldfish in order to accommodate their impaired swimming ability.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <br>

        <h2 style="color: white;">
            Origin and Distribution
        </h2>
        <p style="color: white;">
            While the original comet goldfish has its roots in the Crucian Carp of Asia, 
            <br>the fantail goldfish is a product of human-driven selective breeding. As a type of "fancy" goldfish, 
            <br>the fantail variety was meticulously developed over numerous generations by selectively pairing individuals with desired traits.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: white;">
            Colors and Markings
        </h2>
        <p style="color: white;">
            Fantail goldfish are known for their double tails, 
            <br>but also tend to have short bodies and may have elongated pectoral and anal fins. 
            <br>Depending on if your fantail has been bred with other varieties of fancy goldfish, 
            <br>such as orandas, ryukins, or pearlscales, your fantail may take on some characteristics of those other goldfish, 
            <br>such as a small wen (head swelling), tall body, or enlarged coelom. 
            <br>Fantail goldfish are typically orange to white in color but can be red or multicolored if they have been crossed with a shubunkin or ryukin goldfish variety.
        </p>


        <h2 style="color: white;">
            Tankmates
        </h2>
        <p style="color: white;">
            For fantail goldfish, the best tankmates are other fancy goldfish, 
            <br>as long-bodied varieties may out-swim them. It's advisable to avoid adding any tankmates, 
            <br>and if keeping a single fantail, provide a spacious, 
            <br>filtered aquarium for optimal health and well-being.
        </p>

    
        <h2 style="color: white;">
            Fantail Goldfish Habitat and Care
        </h2>
        <p style="color: white;">
            Fantail goldfish, known for their double tails, have short bodies and may exhibit elongated pectoral and anal fins. 
            <br>They are generally easy-going and low-maintenance, like other goldfish varieties. 
            <br>However, due to their less efficient swimming abilities, it's advisable not to overcrowd their environment with decorations. 
            <br>Regular maintenance is crucial due to their messy nature. Fantails may rest more frequently,
            <br>so providing an open area on the substrate is beneficial for their comfort. 
            <br>Depending on breeding with other fancy goldfish varieties, 
            <br>they may show characteristics like a small wen, tall body, or enlarged coelom. While typically orange to white, 
            <br>they can display red or multicolored patterns if crossed with shubunkin or ryukin goldfish.
        </p>

       
        <h2 style="color: white;">
            Diet and Feeding
        </h2>

        <p style="color: white;">
            Choose the correct pellet size for your fantail goldfish, ensuring easy swallowing. 
            <br>Opt for a pellet with around 32-35% protein, slightly higher for fancy goldfish due to their swimming difficulties. 
            <br>Aim for a 4-5% fat content, and replace the food container every 6 months for sufficient vitamin C levels. 
            <br>Sinking diets are recommended to prevent buoyancy issues. 
            <br>Feed once a day below 70°F (21°C) and twice a day at 70°F and above. 
            <br>Sprinkle enough food for a leisurely 5-minute meal, 
            <br>removing any uneaten food to prevent waste accumulation.
        </p>
            


        <h2 style="color: white;">
            Gender Differences
        </h2>
        <p style="color: white;">
            Like comet goldfish, fantail goldfish have distinguishable features for males. 
            <br>Breeding tubercles, raised white bumps, will appear on the operculum 
            <br>(gill cover) and leading edge of the pectoral fin in males during spawning season. emales tend to be more round, 
            <br>but with the enlarged belly on Fantails, this is not reliable.
        </p>


        <h2 style="color: white;">
            Breeding the Goldfish
        </h2>
        <p style="color: white;">
            To encourage goldfish breeding, boost protein and fat in their diet for full gonad development. 
            <br>Place one male and one female fantail goldfish in a breeding tank, raise the temperature, 
            <br>add live plants, and manipulate daylight length to simulate spring. 
            <br>After spawning, remove the parents to prevent egg consumption. 
            <br>Feed powdered fry food to the free-swimming babies. 
        </p>
