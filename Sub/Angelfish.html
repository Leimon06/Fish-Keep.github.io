        Angelfish belong to the cichlid family and are available in two types: freshwater and saltwater. 
        <br>This guide focuses on freshwater angelfish, 
        <br>known for their distinctive arrowhead bodies and flowing fins. While generally peaceful, 
        <br>they may prey on small fish and exhibit aggression, 
        <br>particularly during the breeding season.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

            Origin and Distribution
        </h2>
        <p style="color: white;">
            Angelfish are native to tropical South America, inhabiting slow-moving streams, 
            <br>floodplains, and swamps within the Amazon water system. 
            <br>They thrive in warm, acidic water with no salinity, 
            <br>preferring a habitat with sandy riverbeds, vegetation, and clear water.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: white;">
            Colors and Markings
        </h2>
        <p style="color: white;">
            Angelfish are characterized by wide bodies, triangular snouts, and long, flowing fins. 
            <br>Commonly silver with four vertical black stripes, they may also come in gold, black, white, orange, yellow, marbled, albino, platinum, gold, and panda varieties. 
            <br>The number and brightness of stripes and colors can vary based on the fish's maturity, mood, and stress levels.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: white;">
            Tankmates
        </h2>
        <p style="color: white;">
            In the wild, angelfish coexist with thousands of other fish in diverse habitats. 
            <br>In a tank, their territorial nature can lead to aggression, 
            <br>so it's best to avoid housing them with shy species. 
            <br>Good tank mates include other angelfish (up to six in a spacious tank), 
            <br>compatible cichlids, dwarf gouramis, mollies, plecos, and pictus catfish. 
            <br>Avoid keeping them with non-fish tank mates, as angelfish may harass or attack invertebrates like crabs and shrimp.
        </p>

    
        <h2 style="color: white;">
            Angel fish Habitat and Care
        </h2>
        <p style="color: white;">
            Create a tank environment for angelfish that mimics their natural habitat in the slow-moving waters of the Amazon basin. 
            <br>Use a tank of at least 20 gallons, with an additional 10 gallons per extra fish, soft substrate like sand or mud, and low-flow aeration to simulate their preferred current. 
            <br>Mimic natural sunlight with an aquarium LED light for 8 to 12 hours daily. 
            <br>Include native Amazonian plants such as Amazon sword and anacharis, along with sturdy options like Java fern and Java moss. 
            <br>Provide caves, rocks, and hollow decorations for hiding and territorial spaces, avoiding floating plants.
        </p>

       
        <h2 style="color: white;">
            Diet and Feeding
        </h2>

        <p style="color: white;">
            Angelfish thrive on a diet of small live prey like insects, larvae, crustaceans, and small fish in the wild. 
            <br>In captivity, replicate this by offering a high-protein, high-fiber diet with limited plant matter. 
            <br>Feed them live foods like tubifex worms, brine shrimp, and water fleas. 
            <br>Additionally, provide high-protein fish flakes or pellets and a small amount of high-fiber plant food like blanched spinach or zucchini. 
            <br>Feed at least twice a day, offering a pinch of food each time for a duration of two minutes, and promptly remove any uneaten food to maintain tank cleanliness.
        </p>
            


        <h2 style="color: white;">
            Gender Differences
        </h2>
        <p style="color: white;">
            Male angelfish are sleeker with pointed fins and develop a small papilla. 
            <br>Females have a rounder body, shorter fins, and lack the papilla. 
            <br>Males can be more territorial, especially during breeding. 
            <br>Watch for these traits as they mature.
        </p>


        <h2 style="color: white;">
            Breeding the Angel Fish
        </h2>
        <p style="color: white;">
            Breeding angel fish is relatively easy. 
            <br>Once a pair naturally forms in your tank, set up a separate 20-gallon breeding tank with slow-flowing water, a temperature of 82°F, and a suitable spawning surface. 
            <br>Condition the pair with a high-protein diet, move them to the breeding tank, and observe their behavior. 
            <br>When the female lingers near the spawning surface, she's ready to lay eggs. 
            <br>The male fertilizes the eggs, which hatch in two to three days. 
            <br>The parents care for the fry for about a month; then, transfer them to a community tank after six weeks. 
            <br>Feed the fry brine shrimp larvae initially, then transition to flakes and dried food.
        </p>
