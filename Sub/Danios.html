            Zebra danios are a favorite of freshwater fish hobbyists because of their ease of care. 
            <br>They are also prolific breeders and the easiest type of egglayers to breed. With their attractively striped, 
            <br>black and white zebra-patterned bodies, these fish are easy to recognize. 
            <br>Zebrafish are very durable and can withstand an impressive range of water temperatures and conditions. 
            <br>They will generally do just fine without a water heater as they are comfortable at temperatures down to the low 60s F.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

            Origin and Distribution
        </h2>
        <p style="color: white;">
            Zebra danios were initially believed to have a broad range from Myanmar to Pakistan, 
            <br>but current consensus places their origin in a narrower region in parts of India and Bangladesh. 
            <br>This shift is due to the identification of similar species previously misidentified as Danio rerio. 
            <br>Environmental damage has further restricted their natural habitat, though wild zebra danios occupy various environments. 
            <br>Most zebra danios in the aquarium industry are now captive-bred, providing a large and affordable supply. 
            <br>However, commercial breeding has led to a less robust version compared to the original wild species. 
            <br>Numerous zebra danio varieties are available in aquarium stores.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: white;">
            Colors and Markings
        </h2>
        <p style="color: white;">
            The zebra danio is recognized by its distinct blue-purple horizontal stripes along its slim, silver-gold body. 
            <br>Varieties include albino, golden, veil-tailed, long-finned, and the spotted leopard strain, once considered a different species. 
            <br>Genetic studies confirmed it as a variation of Danio rerio. The GloFish, a fluorescent variety with introduced DNA pigment, displays bright colors like orange, green, blue, purple, or red while retaining the characteristic stripes.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: white;">
            Tankmates
        </h2>
        <p style="color: white;">
            Zebra danios, with a small size of no more than two inches, are ideal for community aquariums. 
            <br>Peaceful but active, they may nip fins of fish with long-flowing fins. 
            <br>Suitable tankmates include similar-sized danios, barbs, corydoras catfish, tetras, loaches, mollies, platys, and swordtails. 
            <br>Thriving in schools of five or more, they establish a pecking order without fighting. 
            <br>Choose tankmates with similar temperaments and energy levels, avoiding mellow fish that may become stressed in their active presence.
        </p>

    
        <h2 style="color: white;">
            Zebra Danio Habitat and Care
        </h2>
        <p style="color: white;">
            Zebras are primarily surface-dwelling, cold-water fish that prefer temperatures between 64 to 75°F but can adapt to various conditions. 
            <br>They become more susceptible to disease in lower temperatures. 
            <br>Highly active, they explore the entire tank, favoring the upper levels. 
            <br>Provide diffuse lighting, an open swimming space, and vegetation around the tank's periphery. 
            <br>A darker substrate enhances their colors and adds a natural feel to their habitat.
        </p>

       
        <h2 style="color: white;">
            Diet and Feeding
        </h2>

        <p style="color: white;">
            Zebra danios are omnivorous, accepting almost any food. Although undemanding in diet, 
            <br>they particularly enjoy small, live, or frozen invertebrates and fresh vegetable matter. 
            <br>They can be fed small pelleted food or flake fish food for their main diet, 
            <br>with supplements of freeze dried bring shrimp or tubifex worms, or frozen foods.
        </p>
            


        <h2 style="color: white;">
            Gender Differences
        </h2>
        <p style="color: white;">
            Both sexes have two pairs of barbels and the same stripes, but females are usually larger. 
            <br>Males are a bit smaller and more slender than females. 
            <br>Male zebras appear more torpedo-shaped, while females tend to have a larger belly. 
            <br>More full-bodied than the males, a female's belly balloons when it fills with eggs.
        </p>


        <h2 style="color: white;">
            Breeding the Zebra Danio 
        </h2>
        <p style="color: white;">
            <br>Zebra danios are ideal for beginners due to their prolific breeding. 
            <br>Females can spawn every two to three days after reaching maturity at around four months. 
            <br>To breed them, start with a school of young zebras, watch for females with rounded bellies, and separate them into a breeding tank with fine-leafed plants. 
            <br>Use a coarse substrate to protect the eggs from adult fish. 
            <br>Spawning is induced by a water change and requires temperatures of 78 to 80°F. 
            <br>After laying 300 to 500 eggs, remove the breeders. 
            <br>Fry hatch in about two days, needing care with water changes and a sponge filter to prevent suction. 
            <br>Feed them commercially prepared fry food or finely crushed flakes, avoiding overfeeding to prevent water fouling.
        </p>
