            The dazzling crown jewel of aquariums everywhere, 
            <br>the hardy little neon tetra fish was originally imported from South America. 
            <br>Neon tetras must be kept in groups of at least a half-dozen, as they are a shoaling species. 
            <br>With peaceful dispositions, they are also able to be kept with other species of non-aggressive fish. 
            <br>They have a decently long life expectancy of 5 or more years.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

            Origin and Distribution
        </h2>
        <p style="color: white;">
            Neon tetras originate from the Orinoco and Amazon river basins in Brazil, Columbia, and Peru, dwelling in dark, clear streams beneath forest canopies. 
            <br>They live in shoals, mainly in middle water layers, feeding on insects, worms, and small crustaceans. 
            <br>While generally captive-bred, originating from fish farms in the Far East and Eastern Europe, 
            <br>various varieties are available, including long-finned, golden, diamond (with metallic scales), and a blue-striped variety lacking red coloration.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: white;">
            Colors and Markings
        </h2>
        <p style="color: white;">
            The neon tetra, with a slender body reaching up to 1.5 inches, boasts vibrant colors. 
            <br>A neon blue stripe runs from nose to adipose fin, aiding visibility in blackwater conditions. 
            <br>Below, a white-silver belly contrasts with a bright red stripe extending to the tail. This red, white, and blue combination makes them a popular aquarium fish, 
            <br>often confused with the cardinal tetra, distinguished by a red stripe running the entire length. 
            <br>Neon tetras' colors may fade at rest or when alarmed. 
            <br>Choose specimens with robust coloring for optimal health.
        </p>


        <h2 style="color: white;">
            Tankmates
        </h2>
        <p style="color: white;">
            Neon tetras are peaceful and thrive in groups of half a dozen or more. 
            <br>They are ideal for community tanks with small, peaceful companions like rasboras, dwarf gouramis, and corys. 
            <br>Avoid larger or aggressive species, as neon tetras can be vulnerable to predation. 
            <br>It's crucial to keep them with fish whose mouths cannot fit a neon tetra to ensure their safety.
        </p>

    
        <h2 style="color: white;">
            Neon Tetra Habitat and Care
        </h2>
        <p style="color: white;">
            Neon tetras thrive in fully matured aquariums with stable water chemistry. 
            <br>Optimal conditions include soft, acidic water (pH below 7.0, hardness no more than 10 dGH). 
            <br>Darkening the water with blackwater extracts or driftwood mimics their natural habitat. 
            <br>Provide plenty of low-light hiding places with plants, including floating ones. 
            <br>Driftwood and a dark substrate contribute to a comfortable environment, 
            <br>their natural habitat with dark water, dense vegetation, and roots. 
            <br>A dark background on three sides enhances the desired low-light setting.
        </p>

       
        <h2 style="color: white;">
            Diet and Feeding
        </h2>

        <p style="color: white;">
            Neon tetras, natural omnivores, thrive on fine flakes, small granules, and live or frozen brine shrimp, daphnia, and bloodworms. 
            <br>Feed them 2-4 times daily, providing an amount they can consume in two minutes to avoid overfeeding. 
            <br>Variety in their diet, including live foods, ensures good health. 
            <br>Remove any leftover food promptly to prevent high ammonia levels, 
            <br>which can be harmful to neon tetras.
        </p>
            


        <h2 style="color: white;">
            Gender Differences
        </h2>
        <p style="color: white;">
            Gender differences are not overtly apparent in neon tetras. 
            <br>Generally, the female will have a larger more rounded belly than the male. 
            <br>This rounded belly can even make the blue stripe appear curved on the female, 
            <br>in contrast to the very straight blue stripe on the male.
        </p>


        <h2 style="color: white;">
            Breeding the Neon Tetra
        </h2>
        <p style="color: white;">
            To breed neon tetras, set up a separate tank with soft water (1-2 dGH) and acidic pH (5.0-6.0). 
            <br>Use a sponge filter, live plants, and cover the tank with dark paper. 
            <br>Keep the temperature between 72-75°F (22-24°C). 
            <br>Condition the pair with live foods, introduce them gradually to lighting, and spawn usually occurs in the morning. 
            <br>The male embraces the female, laying over 100 eggs on plants. 
            <br>Remove the parents immediately to prevent egg consumption. 
            <br>Maintain low lighting for sensitive eggs and fry. 
            <br>Hatch rates are modest, with one-third developing into viable fry. 
            <br>Feed the fry small foods like infusoria and gradually progress to freshly hatched brine shrimp. 
            <br>Adult coloration appears after a month.
        </p>
