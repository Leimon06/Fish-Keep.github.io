            The very popular tiger barb is an easy fish to care for and 
            <br>can be fun to watch as it swims at high speed in schools of six or more. 
            <br>It is not, however, an ideal fish for a community tank as it can be mildly aggressive and nip any fish with flowing fins. 
            <br>When well cared for, tiger barbs have a lifespan of five to seven years.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

            Origin and Distribution
        </h2>
        <p style="color: white;">
            Tiger barbs originate from Borneo, Malaysia, Sumatra, Thailand, and Cambodia, 
            <br>residing in tree-lined rivers with sand, rocks, and dense vegetation. 
            <br>They prefer clear, oxygen-rich water and have been introduced in various countries outside their native range.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: white;">
            Colors and Markings
        </h2>
        <p style="color: white;">
            The tiger barb is known for its distinctive appearance, featuring four black vertical bands on an orange-yellow body, 
            <br>complemented by red-edged fins and a red face. 
            <br>Selective breeding has produced various color variations, including green, black, red, albino, and genetically modified glow versions in different colors.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: white;">
            Tankmates
        </h2>
        <p style="color: white;">
            Tiger barbs, reaching 2.5 to 3 inches in size, are suitable for a school in a moderate-sized aquarium. 
            <br>A species-specific tank with various color variations can create a visually appealing display. 
            <br>Compatible tankmates include clown loaches or other fast-moving species like danios, platys, loaches, or catfish.
            <br>It's essential to keep tiger barbs in groups of at least six to mitigate aggressive behavior. 
            <br>Avoid pairing them with docile or slow-moving fish, as tiger barbs may become territorial and aggressive.
        </p>

    
        <h2 style="color: white;">
            Barb Habitat and Care
        </h2>
        <p style="color: white;">
            Tiger barbs are adaptable to various water conditions but thrive in soft, slightly acidic water. 
            <br>Create an ideal tank with ample open swimming space, surrounded by live or artificial plants. 
            <br>Temperature is flexible, and they can be kept in unheated tanks. 
            <br>Good lighting and a fine substrate complete the setup.
        </p>

       
        <h2 style="color: white;">
            Diet and Feeding
        </h2>

        <p style="color: white;">
            Tiger barbs are versatile eaters, accepting various foods. 
            <br>Provide a mix of quality pellets, flakes, live or frozen options like brine shrimp, bloodworms, and beef heart. 
            <br>They also enjoy small aquatic invertebrates and cooked vegetables.
        </p>
            


        <h2 style="color: white;">
            Gender Differences
        </h2>
        <p style="color: white;">
            Females have a broader, more rounded belly than males and are larger and heavier. 
            <br>Males are identified by their bright coloring and the red nose they develop during the spawning process.
        </p>


        <h2 style="color: white;">
            Breeding the Barb 
        </h2>
        <p style="color: white;">
            To breed tiger barbs, set up a separate tank with soft, acidic water, fine-leaved plants, and a bare bottom or spawning grid. 
            <br>Condition the pair with live foods, then move them to the breeding tank. 
            <br>After spawning, remove the parents to prevent egg consumption. 
            <br>The eggs hatch in about 36 hours, and fry become free-swimming in five days. 
            <br>Feed them newly hatched brine shrimp until they can take finely crushed flakes or powdered fry food.
        </p>
